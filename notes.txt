TopoJSON objects have an id feature.

{"type":"Topology","objects":{"kerntest50":{"type":"GeometryCollection","geometries":[{"type":"Polygon","id":0,"arcs":[[0]]}...

There for rather than binding properties to the data we can use the id as the lookup in a dictionary. 

# Create a csv with the columns, almonds(binary): pistachios(binary): color_code (number): color_hex
